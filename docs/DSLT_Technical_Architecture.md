  - Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
```

#### Database Scaling
```sql
-- Read Replicas Strategy
Primary Database: Write operations
Read Replicas: Read operations (3-5 replicas)
Connection Pooling: PgBouncer for connection management
Caching Layer: Redis cluster for frequent queries

-- Partitioning Strategy
Horizontal partitioning by user_id for user tables
Time-based partitioning for transaction logs
Separate databases for analytics workloads
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy
```python
# Multi-layer Caching
L1 Cache: Application-level (in-memory)
L2 Cache: Redis cluster (distributed)
L3 Cache: CDN for static assets (CloudFlare)

# Cache Invalidation

```

#### API Performance
```python
# Optimization Techniques
- Response pagination (limit 100 items)
- Field selection (GraphQL-style filtering)
- Compressed responses (gzip/brotli)
- Async processing for heavy operations
- Connection pooling and keep-alive
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

# Performance Targets
- API response time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- Page load time: <2 seconds
- Database query time: <50ms (average)
- Blockchain transaction confirmation: <30 seconds
```
